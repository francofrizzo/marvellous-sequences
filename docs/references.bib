abstract = "We introduce a variant of de Bruijn words that we call perfect necklaces. Fix a finite alphabet. Recall that a word is a finite sequence of symbols in the alphabet and a circular word, or necklace, is the equivalence class of a word under rotations. For positive integers k and n, we call a necklace (k,n)-perfect if each word of length k occurs exactly n times at positions which are different modulo n for any convention on the starting point. We call a necklace perfect if it is (k,k)-perfect for some k. We prove that every arithmetic sequence with difference coprime with the alphabet size induces a perfect necklace. In particular, the concatenation of all words of the same length in lexicographic order yields a perfect necklace. For each k and n, we give a closed formula for the number of (k,n)-perfect necklaces. Finally, we prove that every infinite periodic sequence whose period coincides with some (k,n)-perfect necklace for some k and some n, passes all statistical tests of size up to k, but not all larger tests. This last theorem motivated this work."

abstract = "We consider the previously defined notion of finite-state independence and we focus specifically on normal words. We characterize finite-state independence of normal words in three different ways, using three different kinds of asynchronous deterministic finite automata with two input tapes containing infinite words. Based on one of the characterizations we give an algorithm to construct a pair of finite-state independent normal words."

abstract = "M. B. Levin used Sobol–Faure low discrepancy sequences with Pascal triangle matrices modulo 2 to construct, a real number x such that the first N terms of the sequence (2nxmod1)n≥1 have discrepancy O((logN)2∕N). This is the lowest discrepancy known for this kind of sequences. In this note we characterize Levin’s construction in terms of nested perfect necklaces, which are a variant of the classical de Bruijn sequences. Moreover, we show that every real number x whose binary expansion is the concatenation of nested perfect necklaces of exponentially increasing order satisfies that the first N terms of (2nxmod1)n≥1 have discrepancy O((logN)2∕N). For the order being a power of 2, we give the exact number of nested perfect necklaces and an explicit method based on matrices to construct each of them. The computation of the nth digit of the binary expansion of a real number built from nested perfect necklaces requires O(logn) elementary mathematical operations."
